# Mark Sharp

Mark Sharp is a fast, modern Markdown editor for VS Code. Write Markdown documents quickly with familiar, standard syntax while still seeing a visually-appealing rendered Markdown document (what-you-see-is-what-you-get).

Mark Sharp is based on [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and supports extension features such as tables, Mermaid diagrams, checklists, and more.

## Quick Start

### Installing the Extension

1. _Pre-requisite_: First install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Install Mark Sharp from the VS Code Extension Store (_coming soon_).

### Launching Mark Sharp

There are several ways to launch the M# editor:

1. In the [Explorer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_explorer) view, **right click** on a Markdown file ( with a `.md` or `.markdown` file extension) > `Open With...` > `M#`.
2. When a markdown file is open in VS Code's default editor, run the command `M#: Switch Editor Mode` from the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

> _When you edit a markdown file with Mark Sharp, **your existing document layout may be altered**. It is recommended to back up your documents with a version control system like Git or another method of your choice._

### Editing Markdown files

- Use familiar markdown syntax to create Markdown elements.  For example, typing '#' at the beginning of a line will create an H1 header, or surrounding a word with '*' will bold it.
- Type '/' to bring up a slash command menu to quickly insert markdown elements such as lists, tables, images, and diagrams.
- Use the command `M#: Switch Editor Mode` to switch between Mark Sharp and the built-in VS Code Editor, while maintaining your cursor position so that you can continue working without losing your context.
