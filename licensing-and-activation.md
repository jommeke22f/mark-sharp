## Purchasing a License

A Mark Sharp Premium license can be purchased either with [this link](https://buy.stripe.com/bIY15W2Vlewpg8geUU) or within the Mark Sharp app by running the `Mark Sharp: Manage License` command. Upon purchase, an activation key will be sent to the email provided on the payment page.

The license is perpetual and is valid for one user for either personal or commercial use. Please see the [End User License Agreement](https://www.marksharp.co/eula).

## Activating Your Premium License

1. In VS Code, open the command pallete (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`) and then run `> Mark Sharp: Manage License`. This will launch the licensing view.
2. At the bottom of the page, enter the license key that was sent to your email.
3. Review and Accept the EULA, and then click 'Activate'.
4. If the activation was successful, you should see "Your License is Active".

_Should you encounter any problems during activation, please contact support@marksharp.co_

## Using Your License on Multiple Devices

A single license is valid for one user and one user only, but the user is permitted to use Mark Sharp Premium on multiple devices:

1. Activate your license on one device using the steps in the previous section.
2. Sign into VS Code with your Microsoft or Github account and enable settings sync by following [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync#_turning-on-settings-sync).
    1. Make sure to tick 'Extensions' when choosing what to sync.
3. On your other device, sign into VS Code with the same account and turn on settings sync on this device as well.
4. Your premium license should carry over to your second device. To verify, run the `Mark Sharp: Manage License` command, and it should display 'Your License is Active'.

This also works on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/), so you can use Mark Sharp directly from your browser.
