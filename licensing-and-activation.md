## Activating Your Premium License

Upon purchasing a license, you can activate your license with these steps:

1. In VS Code, open the command pallete (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`) and then run `> M#: Manage License`. This should launch the licensing view.
2. At the bottom of the page, enter the license key that was sent to your email.
3. Review and Accept the EULA, and then click 'Activate'.
4. If the activation was successful, you should see "Your License is Active".

_Should you encounter any problems during activation, please contact support@marksharp.co_
