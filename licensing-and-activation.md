## How to Activate Mark Sharp Premium

Upon purchasing a license, you can activate your license with these steps:

1. In VS Code, open the command pallete (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`) and then run `> M#: Manage License`. This should launch the licensing view.
2. At the bottom of the page, enter the license key that was sent to your email, and click 'Activate'.
3. If the activation was successful, you should see "Your License is Active".

_Note: During Alpha testing, activation doesn't affect any functionality in the M# editor itself._
